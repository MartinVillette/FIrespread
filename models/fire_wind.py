Wind-Based Forest Fire Propagation Model

This module implements a forest fire simulation that incorporates wind effects
on fire spread patterns. The model calculates fire propagation based on wind
speed, wind direction, and the geometric relationship between terrain parcels.

The model uses:
- Wind speed and direction parameters for realistic fire behavior
- Directional fire spread coefficients based on wind vectors
- Exponential propagation models accounting for wind acceleration
- 8-directional neighbor connectivity with wind-influenced spread rates

Educational Purpose:
Demonstrates how meteorological conditions, particularly wind patterns,
dramatically affect wildfire behavior and spread dynamics in fire management scenarios.
