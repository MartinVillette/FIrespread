Real-World Forest Fire Propagation Model using Google Earth Engine Data

This module implements a comprehensive forest fire simulation using real-world
satellite data from Google Earth Engine. The model incorporates multiple
environmental factors including topography, meteorology, and vegetation to
create highly accurate fire spread predictions.

The model integrates:
- Real elevation data for slope-based fire acceleration
- Live weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction)
- Satellite vegetation coverage (tree cover percentage)
- Geographic coordinate system with precise distance calculations
- Multi-factor fire spread rate calculations based on empirical research

Educational Purpose:
Demonstrates how real-world environmental data can be integrated into
fire behavior models for practical wildfire management and prediction.
