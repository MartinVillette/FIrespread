Developed as a TIPE (Travaux d'Initiative Personnelle Encadrés) research project, it explores how environmental factors influence wildfire behavior through three distinct modeling approaches.

**Key Innovation**: Integration of theoretical fire propagation models with real-world satellite data validation using Google Earth Engine.

## Features

- **Multi-Model Simulation**: Wind-based, vegetation-based, and real-world data models
- **Satellite Data Integration**: Google Earth Engine environmental data
- **Interactive Visualization**: Real-time Pygame interface with multiple control modes
- **Data Validation**: NASA FIRMS fire detection comparison
- **Geographic Accuracy**: Real terrain data from French Riviera region
- **Performance Optimization**: Local SQLite caching for satellite data

## Simulation Models

### 1. Wind-Based Fire Propagation Model

**File**: `models/fire_wind.py`

![Wind Model Simulation](models/screenshot_wind.png)

Simulates how meteorological conditions drive fire spread patterns:


**Key Features**:
- **Directional Coefficients**: Mathematical wind-fire interaction modeling
- **Exponential Spread**: k_φ = e^(0.1783 × wind_speed × c_φ × 1.5)
- **Geometric Calculations**: 8-directional neighbor analysis
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Color-coded fire intensity progression

**Scientific Basis**: Based on Rothermel fire spread equations with wind acceleration factors.

### 2. Vegetation Density Model

**File**: `models/fire_treecover.py`

![Tree Coverage Model](models/screenshot_treecover.png)

Models fire behavior based on fuel load distribution:

**Key Features**:
- **Fuel Load Calculation**: k_s = ((tree_coverage + 30) / 100)³
- **Terrain Generation**: Two-level vegetation mapping (coarse → fine grid)
- **Propagation Thresholds**: Minimum vegetation requirements for fire spread
- **Realistic Patterns**: Follows natural vegetation gradients

**Algorithm**: Queue-based cellular automata with weighted neighbor contributions.

### 3. Real-World Data Model

**File**: `Earth_Engine_model/fire_screen.py`
